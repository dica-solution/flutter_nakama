# Contributing to Flutter Nakama SDK

## Submitting changes

* Use and never change the test setup which is delivered with the package (API Key, etc.)
* Make sure your PR is fully tested with not only encapsulated unit tests but also integration tests which make sure your enhancements working as expected

## Conventions

* Use the dart formatting which is already preconfigured here!
* Start your git commit message with an uppercase letter and complete a sentence like "If you install this commit, it ..."

## Run

* `dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .`
* `dart analyze`
